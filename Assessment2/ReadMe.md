# Assessment 2
In this assignment we are going to be using everything we have learned so far with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  You are to finish building out this page, wire up JavaScript, and style it the best you can with CSS.

Do your best to recreate the following page. [https://worthyd.github.io/dummy-sites/sweepstakes/index.html](https://worthyd.github.io/dummy-sites/sweepstakes/index.html)

When you complete the project, upload your changes to GitHub and let the instructor know.

## HTML Requirements
- Use semantic html tags to build out the structure.
- Use an input element with the type of 'email' for the Email input.

## CSS Requirements
Use the CSS we have covered to best recreate the form and layout of the page.

## JavaScript Requirements
Use JavaScript to enforce the following rules.  This is exactly like what we have done in past assignments.

- First Name must be filled out
- Last Name must be filled out
- Email must be filled out
- Email must contain '@' and '.com'
- A value must be selected in the 'How did you find us" drop down
- 'Why do you need this blender' must be filled out
- The terms and service checkbox must be checked.
- Add a class to any invalid input field.
- Any error messages should be displayed above the form.

Display a success message if everything is filled out correctly. 

**Use HTML attributes to enforce these rules if you are too stuck**

## Tips
- Look back at old assignments if you are stuck
- Move onto something else if you are stuck for longer than 15 minutes.
- Remember to clear your CSS floats.
- Use your Chrome Dev Tools to get the proper CSS values.
- Console log code that isn't working properly.
