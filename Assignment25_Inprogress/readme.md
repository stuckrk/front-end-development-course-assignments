#Navigation Menus
Using the examples in the presentation perform the following tasks.

## Custom Navs
Create an index.html  and build a custom navigation that meets the following requirements.
 
- Must contain at least 6 links.
- Must have at least 1 drop down menu.  Use the jsfiddle in the presentation to create this.
- Must remain at the top of the page as you scroll.
- Make sure it acts appropriately on mobile
- Theme it in a way you would want on your personal site (colors, fonts, etc)

Example:

- Home
- About
- Our Products (sub navigation)
 - Product 1
 - Product 2
- F.A.Q
- Contact Us


## Bootstrap Navigation
Create a file called bootstrap.html and recreate the same menu using Bootstrap's Menu system.  


## Notes1
- Try to extend the responsive framework you started by including a navigation component.
- If applicable, save what you do here for your personal website
