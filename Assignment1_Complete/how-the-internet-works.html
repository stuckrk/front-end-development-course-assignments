	<p>This article can be found at <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/how-it-works">http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/how-it-works </a></p>

	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	<p>The Internet works because open standards allow every network to connect to every other network.</p>
	<p>TThis is what makes it possible for anyone to create content, offer services, and sell products without requiring permission
		from a central authority.</p>

	<p>It levels the playing field for everyone and it's the reason why we have a rich diversity of applications and services that
		many of us enjoy today.</p>
        
	<h2>Who's in charge of the Internet?</h2>
    
	<p>No one is, but everyone is.</p>

	<p>Unlike the telephone network, which for years in most countries, was run by a single company, the global Internet consists
		of tens of thousands of interconnected networks run by service providers, individual companies, universities, governments,
		and others.</p>

	<h3>What's the infrastructure of the Internet like?</h3>

	<p>The Internet is that it's a network of networks that needs to operate around the world as if it were one.</p>
	<p>Like policy, the technical coordination of the Internet has common characteristics:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Open,</li>
		<li>Independent,</li>
		<li>Run by non-profit membership organizations that work together to meet the needs everyone.</li>
	</ul>
    
	<p>This self-regulation has been the key to the successful growth of the Internet and is flexible enough to adapt to changing
		future needs.</p>

		it is more important than ever that you're involved in its future.</p>
