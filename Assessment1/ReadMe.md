# Assessment 1
In this part of the assessment we are going to evaluate your knowledge of CSS selectors and CSS properties.  You are welcome to use any resources available to complete the work except your peers and the instructor.
You may ask the instructor for clarification on any questions or parts. Skip over any parts you get stuck on.  Like assignment 4 and 5, you will only need to modify main.css.
